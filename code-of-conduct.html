  <h1>Boston Azure AI Code of Conduct</h1>
  <p>
    Boston Azure AI has been offering quality community events focused on
    technology skill development for free since 2009. Our group is dedicated to
    empowering every attendee, speaker, volunteer and organizer to achieve more.
    Our events are open to all interested attendees, within space limitations.
    This User group is a part of the Azure Tech Groups community, created and
    run by local volunteers.

    The main rule of <b>participation</b>: be nice to everyone, else don't
    participate.
  </p>
  <p>
    The main rule of <b>attendance</b>: follow our signup processes (usually at
    <a href="https://meetup.com/bostonazureai">Meetup.com/BostonAzureAI</a>) for both
    virtual and physical event so we can manage attendance and comply with any
    requirements of our hosts for physical events.
